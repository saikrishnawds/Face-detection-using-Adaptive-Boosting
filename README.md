# Face-detection-using-Adaptive-Boosting
This repository contains the ensemble machine learning technique of Adaptive Boosting used for face detection.  


Details of the project :
=========================

• Data: 

Reuse the face /non-face data in Project 1. Recommended resolution will be 20 by
20 (gray images). You may want to extract a much large number of positive and negative
images.

• Feature vector and weak classifiers: 

Use Harr feature. Compute the value of each Harr
feature for each sample. Each feature corresponds to a weak learner. Determine the
threshold between face samples and non-face samples for all the weak learners.
Calculate the classification error for each weak learner and draw the best ten features
(before boosting) as Figure 3 in [1].

• Algorithm: Implementing the Adaboost Algorithm

• Evaluation: In the test dataset you created, Plot the ROC based on thresholding.
